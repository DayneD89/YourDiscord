# Withdrawing Resolutions

Remove previously passed policies and governance decisions.

## How It Works

## Submit Withdrawal

### Format:
```
**Withdraw**: Description of policy/decision to remove
```

### Examples:
```
**Withdraw**: Renationalise water utilities

**Withdraw**: Universal basic income policy

**Withdraw**: Weekly community game nights
```

## Getting Support

- **Policy withdrawals**: Need 5 reactions
- **Governance withdrawals**: Need 3 reactions
- Same thresholds and voting duration as original proposal type

---

## Voting

**Vote meaning:**
- Support reaction = "Yes, withdraw this resolution"
- Oppose reaction = "No, keep this resolution"

**Important**: Supporting withdrawal means you want to REMOVE the policy.

## Results

**Withdrawal Passes:**
- Original resolution permanently deleted
- Withdrawal recorded with vote counts
- Policy no longer active

**Withdrawal Fails:**
- Original resolution unchanged
- Can resubmit with modifications

---

## Guidelines

- **Reference clearly**: Describe specific policy to remove
- **Check resolutions channels**: Find exact wording first
- **Provide reasoning**: Explain why withdrawal needed
