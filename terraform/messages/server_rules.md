In designated debate channels, open discussion is encouraged:

‚Ä¢ **All topics welcome** for thoughtful discussion
‚Ä¢ **Attack ideas, not people** - focus on arguments, not individuals
‚Ä¢ **No personal attacks, insults, or character assassination**

‚Ä¢ **Stay on topic** and engage in good faith

*Debate the argument, respect the person.*
