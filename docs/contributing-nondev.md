### Types of Documentation Needed

#### User Guides
Help users understand how to use the bot effectively:

```markdown
# How to Create Your First Proposal

1. **Choose the Right Channel**
   - Policy proposals go in #policy-debate
   - Governance changes go in #governance-debate
   - Budget requests go in #budget-debate

2. **Format Your Proposal**
   ```
   **Policy**: [Your proposal title]
   
   [Detailed description of what you're proposing]
   
   **Reasoning**: Why this change is needed
   **Impact**: How this will affect the community
   ```

3. **Get Community Support**
   - Share your proposal in general chat
   - Respond to questions and feedback
   - Need 3 ‚úÖ reactions to advance to voting
```

#### FAQ Entries
Answer common questions from users:

```markdown
### Why isn't my proposal advancing to voting?

Your proposal needs to meet these requirements:
- ‚úÖ Posted in the correct debate channel
- ‚úÖ Uses the proper format (starts with **Policy**: or **Governance**: etc.)
- ‚úÖ Receives enough support reactions (usually 3 ‚úÖ)
- ‚úÖ Is posted by a member with the required role

Check that your proposal meets all these criteria. If it does and still isn't working, ping a moderator for help.
```

#### Troubleshooting Guides
Help users solve common problems:

```markdown
# Bot Not Responding to Commands

## Check These First:
1. **Correct Channel**: Are you in #bot-commands or #member-commands?
2. **Command Prefix**: Did you start with `!`? Example: `!help`
3. **Member Role**: Do you have the required member role?
4. **Spelling**: Commands are case-sensitive: `!help` not `!Help`

## Still Not Working?
- Try `!ping` to see if the bot is online
- Check if other commands work
- Ask in #general for help from other members
- Contact a moderator if the bot seems down
```

## üêõ Bug Reports & Testing

### How to Report Bugs Effectively

The bot doesn't assign roles when I react to the welcome message.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Go to #welcome channel
2. React to the welcome message with ‚úÖ
3. Wait 30 seconds
4. Check my roles - nothing changed

## Expected Behavior
I should get the "Member" role automatically.

## Screenshots
[Attach screenshot showing the reaction and your role list]

## Additional Context

- Other users are having the same problem
- I tried removing and re-adding the reaction
```

#### 4. Follow Up

- **Feedback**: Report what works and what doesn't

#### 2. Test Systematically

- **Performance**: Notice if things are slow or unresponsive

#### 3. Document Issues
- **Keep Notes**: Track what you're testing
- **Screenshot Problems**: Capture errors or weird behavior
- **Note Timing**: When did issues occur?
- **Environment**: What device/browser are you using?

## üí° Feature Suggestions

### How to Suggest Good Features

#### 1. Identify Real Problems
- **Personal Pain Points**: What frustrates you about current features?
- **Community Needs**: What do you hear people asking for?
- **Workflow Gaps**: What takes too many steps?
- **Integration Opportunities**: What tools should connect?

#### 2. Research Existing Solutions
- **Check Current Features**: Make sure it doesn't already exist
- **Look at Other Bots**: How do similar bots handle this?
- **Read Documentation**: Are you sure about current limitations?

#### 3. Write a Clear Feature Request

Use this template:

```markdown
## Feature Request: Proposal Templates

### Problem Statement
Creating properly formatted proposals is difficult for new users. Many proposals get rejected because of formatting issues, not content issues.

### Proposed Solution
Add a `!template` command that generates proposal templates:
- `!template policy` - Creates a policy proposal template
- `!template budget` - Creates a budget proposal template
- Templates include required fields and examples

### Benefits
- Fewer proposal formatting errors
- Easier for new members to participate
- More consistent proposal quality
- Reduced moderator workload

### Alternatives Considered
- Written guides (current solution, but people don't read them)
- Bot DMs with templates (but then people have to copy/paste)
- Web form (but that's complex and requires separate site)

### Additional Context
- I've seen 5 proposals this week fail due to formatting
- Other Discord bots have similar template features
- This would work well with the existing command system
```
